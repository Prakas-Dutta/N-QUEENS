# N-Queens Problem

The _N-Queens_ problem is solved using the backtracking paradigm in C.
It is a classic problem where n queens must be placed on an n × n chessboard in such a way that no two queens attack each other (i.e., no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal).

# Purpose

This project was created by me (Prakas Dutta) in 2023 during my 5th semester of college for fun and learning.
I studied this problem in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and solved it within 3–4 days.

# How to Use

1. Download and save the code.

2. Compile and run it in your terminal.

3. Enter a single integer input — the dimension n of the n × n chessboard.

4. The program will automatically compute all valid solutions using a brute-force backtracking approach.

5. It will then print
 1. All valid board configurations.
 2. The total number of solutions found.
